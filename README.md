# Respawnable Pets
This mod allows your tamed pets to respawn once you next sleep in a bed, except for entities in the `respawnablepets:cannot_respawn` entity type tag. Respawning is toggled with a new item, the Etheric Gem, which
only works on pets you own.

Toggling respawn status is done via interacting [Use Item/Place Block] with a pet. You can also set multiple pets in a
9x3x9 area to respawn by sneak using with the Etheric Gem.
